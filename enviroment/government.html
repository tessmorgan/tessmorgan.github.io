<!-- I challanged myself in this project by putting a great amount of effort into my css by having all of my colors 
    and text correspond to each other throughout my webpages and have everything look aesthetically pleasing to 
    fit the overall theme of the website (enviornment). My goal was to make my web pages look clean, 
    someonewhat educational, fun, and nature esque to keep up with the envionrmental aspect/topic. -->

                issues within their state. There is a wide range of possibilities of how the government can put these
                specific means to use (including helping the envionrment); and it is important that they make use of
                this power and do the most with it because if they don't there would be no change.</p>

            <h2>Funding Land Conservation Efforts</h2>
            <p>The Washington state Government funds a program called "the Washington Wildlife and Recreation Program".
                The goal of this program is to protect the enviornment in two main ways: acquiring valuable recreation
                and habitat lands before they are lost and developing recreation areas for a growing population. The
                government funding is used towards a broad range of land conservation efforts, inclduing protection of
                the
                natural areas near big cities to the protection of very rare, last remaining plant species in the world.
