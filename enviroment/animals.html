<!-- How did I challenge myself? -->
<!-- I challenged myself by using new javascript functions and using the CSS grid feature, which I am not completely comfortable using yet. I have found the CSS grid confusing at times, and since our group decided that each person would make their own CSS grid for their individual pages, I was able to challenge myself by creating and using this grid for my two pages. I've also found javascript functinos quite confusing in terms of the code and formatting. So I tried a new function that we didn't use in calss to make an image appear when a button was clicked. This took me a little while to figure out, since I couldn't find a tutorial on W3Schools. But after assimilating my previously used javascript functions and knowledge, I was able to use this function multiple times in one of my pages!-->
