    <p>I was inspired by this leaf that had a gradient of natural colors. I love ombres and thought the analogous color scheme was one of the prettiest. I chose the light blue, light green, and light yellow because I thought they faded into each other nicely while each still held a indivisual personality. I attempted to invoke a feeling of serenity and tranquility. I used the light blue to represent calmness, green to mean nature and well-being, and yellow to bring out the feel of idyllic (picturesque or peaceful). I thought this would be a good meditation or nice little self-care website with hints of cleaniness and nature. </p>
