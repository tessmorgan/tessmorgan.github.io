<!-- How I challenged myself:
I really wanted this website to look like a real website you would find on the internet of a high quality company. I had a very specific vision in mind on how I wanted it to look and I did everything I could to make that vision a reality. I wanted a home page opening look (I call it the Title Slide) that was sleek and clean over the specific background image. I have never done what I was imagining before. I took it upon me to find code online that had similar components I was looking for to piecee and weave together to make the image in my head. Once that the ball started rolling and I had a clear picture on what the other pages were going to look like and I used what I learned to create layouts for them. I also did a ton of research on Earthlight and found hidden things I used here. For example I went through her entire esty page and facebook images to find the best and most high-quality images of crystals to use for example products. I also found more information about specific shows they have done or even more history of the store that I was able to include. One thing that turned out to be really hard was adding the social media link icons because first I had to learn how to use them and then for some reason they wouldn't work if it was on a purple background so I had to do a lot of troubleshooting to get them to work and look nice on the contact page. Over the course of making this website, I ran into a lot of smaller issues that I had to use creative problem-solving to overcome and I thought that was a good representation of my growth and understanding of html, css, javascript, and bootstrap throughout this class.

        <h2 class="h2 m-2">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="p m-3"> Earthlight Rocks & Gems opened in 1988, in Kirkland, WA. My dad Jack Frasl opened the store to support his love for stones. He laid out a legacy before me that was started as a spark when he got his first rock as a paper boy when he was young.My dad Jack and his second wife Collen wrote three books originally, each book took approx. 3 years to write. They wrote a fourth book combining all three books, which took approx. another 3 years. This book is called Crystalline Communion 2000. Most of the properties listed on my Etsy website are portions or excerpts from this book. My dad passed away from this dimension in 2009 and I have chosen to carry on this tradition and share my love for stones with the world. Mother Nature is amazing and I feel everyone should love and appreciate all that the world has to offer. You can purchase physically in the store, or shop on our Etsy site, of course if you have any questions or are looking for something special just let us know. We opened a second Earthlight Rocks & Gems in Snoqualmie in 2019.  Two locations so much rock loving fun. Much love to all of you, keep on Rocking.
